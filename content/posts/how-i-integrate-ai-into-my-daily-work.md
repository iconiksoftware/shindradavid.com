As a solo fullstack software developer, I’m responsible for everything — from architecture to deployment, from backend security to frontend UX. I build 
systems for real businesses: NGOs that manage sponsorships, bakeries that take custom orders, and foundations that track donations.

With so many responsibilities, I’ve learned to lean on the right tools. And one of the most powerful tools in my daily workflow is AI.

But not in the “AI will replace developers” way.

Instead, I use AI as a silent partner — helping me think faster, debug quicker, and deliver quality software at speed. This post is my honest 
breakdown of how I use AI, where I draw the line, and what I believe developers and business owners should know.

## Why I Use AI Every Day
I don’t use AI because it’s trendy — I use it because it’s effective.

When you’re a one-person development team, time is your scarcest resource. AI helps me:

- Offload boilerplate work

- Generate and refine ideas

- Troubleshoot errors quickly

- Improve the quality of what I ship

It’s not about shortcuts. It’s about working smarter.

## Where I Use AI in My Workflow

### 1. Planning & Architecture

### 2. Simple Code Generation & Refactoring

### 5. Learning New Tools

## A Note of Caution: AI

While I rely on AI, I don’t trust it blindly. Here’s why:

- **Hallucinations & Inaccuracies**: AI models can, and do, generate incorrect or nonsensical information. I never blindly trust AI output. Every line of generated code, every suggested solution, is meticulously reviewed and verified for correctness, efficiency, and security.

- **Over reliance & Skill Erosion**: There's a fine line between leveraging AI for efficiency and becoming overly reliant to the point where my own problem-solving and coding skills atrophy. I actively challenge myself to understand why AI suggests certain solutions, ensuring I retain and build my fundamental capabilities.

- **Security concerns**: AI can generate insecure code. I’ve seen it suggest dangerous SQL or ignore auth checks.

So, I follow a simple rule:

Let AI suggest — but never decide for you.

## How I Stay in Control

- I review everything it generates.

- I test code myself before pushing to production.

- I don’t use it for high-risk logic like authentication or payment processing without a manual audit.

- I use AI to enhance my thinking, not replace it.

As someone who builds real systems for real people, I believe AI amplifies experience. It lets me work faster without sacrificing quality. And in a solo setup — that’s priceless.

## Final Thoughts

AI is not magic. It’s not perfect. But used wisely, it’s a force multiplier.

It doesn’t replace my creativity or judgment — it amplifies them. And as a solo developer serving real clients, that’s exactly what I need.
