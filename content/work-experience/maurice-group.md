At Maurice Group, I serve as the sole IT professional, overseeing all technological aspects of the business. My primary responsibility has been the development and maintenance internal business systems and under the KES Digital branch customer-facing digital platforms. A key achievement in this role was leading the strategic migration of our core internal system from a usage-based Firebase platform to a more cost-effective, self-hosted Virtual Private Server (VPS) solution. This transition not only significantly reduced our IT operational costs but also provided greater flexibility and control over our development roadmap, fostering innovation.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Developing the Internal System**: Designing, building, and maintaining a robust internal management system that handles critical business functions such as order processing, financial tracking, event management, baking school management, and other operational aspects. This system is built on a modern stack including PostgreSQL for the database, Express.js for the backend API, and React Native for the mobile apps.

- **Developing the Customer facing e-commerce apps and websites**: Developing and maintaining the customer-facing e-commerce website and mobile application using React and React Native. These platforms are vital for online sales, customer engagement, and brand presence.

- **Developing digital solutions for external clients**: Under the KES Digital brand, I developed digital solutions like mobile apps and websites for external clients.

### Impact & Achievements

A significant highlight of my tenure has been the strategic optimization of IT expenditure and the enhancement of our technological capabilities:
