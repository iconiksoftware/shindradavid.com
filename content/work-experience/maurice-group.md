At Maurice Cakes & Events, I serve as the sole IT professional, overseeing all technological aspects of the business. My primary responsibility has been the development and maintenance of both internal business systems and customer-facing digital platforms. A key achievement in this role was leading the strategic migration of our core internal system from a usage-based Firebase platform to a more cost-effective, self-hosted Virtual Private Server (VPS) solution. This transition not only significantly reduced our IT operational costs but also provided greater flexibility and control over our development roadmap, fostering innovation.

## Key Contributions & Impact

My work encompassed the entire software development lifecycle, from architecture design to deployment and ongoing maintenance. I was responsible for:

- **Internal System Development**: Designing, building, and maintaining a robust internal management system that handles critical business functions such as order processing, financial tracking, event management, and other operational aspects. This system is built on a modern stack including PostgreSQL for the database, Express.js for the backend API, and React Native for the mobile app

- **E-commerce Platforms**: Developing and maintaining the customer-facing e-commerce website and mobile application using React and React Native. These platforms are vital for online sales, customer engagement, and brand presence.

- **Cost Optimization & Innovation**: Identifying and implementing solutions to mitigate rising IT expenditure. The migration to a self-hosted VPS, coupled with a custom backend, resulted in substantial cost savings compared to previous cloud-based billing models. This strategic shift also removed previous feature development restrictions imposed by usage-based pricing, allowing for greater innovativeness.

### Impact & Achievements

A significant highlight of my tenure has been the strategic optimization of IT expenditure and the enhancement of our technological capabilities:

* **Cost Reduction**: By migrating our internal system and public-facing website and mobile app from Firebase and Vercel to a self-hosted custom backend on a VPS, I achieved an approximate **90% reduction in annual IT expenditure**. This translated from an average monthly spend of $130 (Firebase $110 + Vercel $20) to an annual VPS cost of approximately $150.
* **Enhanced Innovativeness**: The transition liberated our development process from usage-based billing constraints, allowing for greater freedom in releasing new features and pursuing innovative solutions without direct cost penalties. This significantly boosted our capacity for continuous improvement and strategic technological growth.
* **Improved Control & Scalability**: The move to a custom, self-hosted solution provided Maurice Cakes & Events with complete control over our technology stack, enabling tailored scalability and better long-term adaptability to business needs.

This role has allowed me to combine my full-stack development skills with strategic IT management, delivering tangible value through efficient, scalable, and cost-effective technological solutions.
