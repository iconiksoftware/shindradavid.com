## Project overview

The Prisha Charity Foundation, dedicated to supporting children with disabilities, faced increasing operational complexities due to manual processes in managing child profiles, sponsor data, staff, and finances. To scale their impact and enhance internal efficiency, a centralized Child Sponsorship & Organizational Management System (CSOMS) was proposed. This system aimed to digitize core operations, providing a robust, secure, and transparent platform for managing child sponsorships, donor relationships, and overall organizational activities. My role involved designing and developing this critical internal system to centralize data, automate workflows, and provide real-time insights to the administration.

## My Role & Responsibilities

As the primary developer for the Prisha Charity Foundation CSOMS, my responsibilities encompassed the full stack of the application, from database design to API development and user interface implementation. Key areas included:

 - **System Architecture Design**: Conceptualizing the overall structure of the CSOMS, including database schema, API endpoints, and module interconnections.

 - **Backend Development**: Building robust and secure RESTful APIs using Node.js and NestJS to handle all data operations, business logic, and integrations. This involved designing and implementing the PostgreSQL database.

 - **Frontend Development**: Developing intuitive and responsive user interfaces for all internal modules using React, ensuring seamless data interaction and user experience for various staff roles.

 - **Database Management**: Setting up, optimizing, and maintaining the PostgreSQL database, including data modeling, migrations, and ensuring data integrity and performance.

 - **Security & Access Control**: Implementing comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure that staff members only access features and data relevant to their assigned roles (Super Admin, Manager, Accountant, Field Officer, Viewer).

 - **Reporting & Analytics**: Developing features for generating various organizational reports and providing an administrative dashboard for real-time insights.
