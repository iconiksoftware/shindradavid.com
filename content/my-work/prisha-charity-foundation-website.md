## Project overview

The public-facing website for the Prisha Foundation serves as the primary digital gateway for potential and existing sponsors. Its core purpose is to showcase children available for sponsorship, provide a seamless experience for new sponsorship requests, and offer a secure portal for current sponsors to track their impact. Designed with a focus on user engagement and transparency, the website aims to foster a stronger connection between the foundation's mission and its global community of supporters. My involvement focused on bringing the foundation's vision to life through a compelling and highly functional user interface.

## My Role & Responsibilities

As the frontend developer for the Prisha Foundation's public website, my responsibilities were centered on user experience, visual design implementation, and robust integration with the backend CSOMS. Key areas included:

 - **Frontend Development**: Building reusable React components, managing application state, and implementing interactive elements to enhance user interaction.

 - **API Integration**: Consuming RESTful APIs developed for the internal CSOMS to dynamically display child profiles, process sponsorship requests, and manage sponsor portal data.

 - **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website provides an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens, using modern CSS techniques.

 - **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing website loading times and rendering performance for a smooth user experience.
