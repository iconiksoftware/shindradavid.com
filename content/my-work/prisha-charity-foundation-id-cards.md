## Project overview

As an additional service to the Prisha Charity Foundation, I undertook the design of professional staff identification cards. The objective was to create visually appealing, functional, and secure ID cards that would not only enhance the organization's professional image but also streamline internal identification and bolster security protocols for their team members and volunteers. This initiative aimed to provide a tangible representation of the foundation's brand while serving a crucial operational purpose.
